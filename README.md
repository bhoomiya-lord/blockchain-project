# Cross-Platform NFT Identity

## Description
The **Cross-Platform NFT Identity** project is a decentralized smart contract built on the Aptos blockchain. It allows users to register and verify their NFT identities across multiple platforms. By storing NFT addresses and platform names, this contract enables seamless identity verification for digital assets.

## Vision of the Project
The goal of this project is to create a unified identity system for NFTs that works across different platforms. This ensures that users can maintain ownership proof, verification, and reputation management regardless of where their NFTs are used.

## Future Scope
- **Interoperability Enhancements:** Enable interaction with other blockchain networks to support cross-chain NFT verification.
- **Identity Verification Mechanisms:** Implement additional verification methods such as cryptographic signatures and multi-factor authentication.
- **Integration with Marketplaces:** Partner with NFT marketplaces and platforms to provide seamless identity verification for transactions.
- **Decentralized Reputation System:** Allow users to build and manage a reputation score based on NFT ownership and transaction history.
